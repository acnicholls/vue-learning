# purpose of this repo
I created this repo to use while learning vue using Pluralsight courses.

# courses included 
## course one
The first course was the Vue.js Playbook 
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/vuejs-playbook/table-of-contents
this course did not actually go into exactly how to build things, but provided html files as examples, so I moved on
## course two
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/vuejs-fundamentals/table-of-contents
this course shows exactly how to build the application right from scratch, and provides step-by-step examples of the fundamental components of a vue.js application.  I followed along with VS Code and built what I saw in the course.
